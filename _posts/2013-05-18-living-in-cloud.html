Here we are ... my first post on my brand new blog :-) ...<br />&nbsp;I couldn't refrain myself starting from the cloud made by the bunch of data that our digital lives evaporates every day. Almost anybody has a social network account ... Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin...<br />&nbsp;A digital alias that keep changing, evolving with us.  Where are this data, where are they gonna be in future and for how long ?<br />The data are in the cloud, shared and available to any sort of research ... the legal boundaries that prevent their misuse are thin and easy to cross...<br />&nbsp;I know it is scary :-) ... But I don't mean to make you paranoid about privacy.<br /><br />This digitalization process of our social life will not stop... it will increase his magnitude ! This is not some foolish collective insanity. The reason is that human being needs to communicate to be recognized. Even before start talking, humans feel the need &nbsp;of being recognized among their group. We are social animals and Internet is boosting our evolutionary instinct of socialization.<br /><br />Corporates of any sort try to catch those needs not of course for philanthropy but for their commercial purposes. The hungry for social network is pervading any industry sector.<br />&nbsp;Despite those epochal changes the most "traditional" software firms struggle to keep up with the innovation.  There are several reason behind this...<br />The technical approach of software architects have not yet changed. Application still designed mostly with a traditional approach.<br />Most of the applications just integrate social networks, are not thought as part of a social network.<br /><br />Google, Amazon and many others are offering cloud computing opportunity that makes virtually possible even for a small start-up to access amazing computational resources ...The data in the cloud are massive but only a fraction of them is effectively analyzed and properly used.<br />&nbsp;We are going to warp speed...while someone still riding a bike ....<br /><br />So how this will ends up ?<br />I am not sure, but as it happen for any evolutionary change, dinosaurs will die and new life forms will take their place...
